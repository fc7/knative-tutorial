[#install-camel-k-plugin]
== Install the kn kamelet source plugin

You can use the Camel K integration as part of the Knative Eventing architecture via a `Kamelet`. 
Simply speaking, you can make the Camel K integration act as a https://knative.dev/docs/eventing/sources/[Knative Event Source] and send the Camel exchanges (OUT) through a Knative Event Sink.
To start working with Kamelets you will need to add the kamelet source plugin to `kn` CLI.

Manual::

As you probably already installed the `kn` CLI tooling, you can simply load the https://github.com/knative-sandbox/kn-plugin-source-kamelet/releases[Kamelet source plugin binaries] in order to add the commands for managing Kamelets as event sources.

Once you have the binary available on your machine you can hook this into your local kn tooling quite easily. The kn-client project provides a clever plugin architecture for adding commands. The respective plugin configuration is located in your home directory under `~/.config/kn/plugins`.

Save the `kn-source-kamelet` binary into this configuration folder or add a symbolic link pointing to the plugin binary there. You can add the symbolic link as follows:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
mkdir ~/.config/kn/plugins 
cd ~/.config/kn/plugins
ln -s /the/path/to/my/kn-source-kamelet kn-source-kamelet
----

Add executable permission to the `kn-source-kamelet` binary

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
chmod +x ~/.config/kn/plugins/kn-source-kamelet
----

--
Homebrew::
+
--
To install the plugin with Homebrew (e.g. on macOS), just run this command:
----
brew install knative-sandbox/kn-plugins/source-kamelet
----
--
====

You can then verify the plugin setup by displaying the kn help page once more:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+macros,+attributes"]
----
kn source -h
----

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]

Manage event sources

Usage:
  kn source SOURCE|COMMAND [options]

Aliases:
  source, sources

Available Commands:
  apiserver   Manage Kubernetes api-server sources
  binding     Manage sink bindings
  container   Manage container sources
  list        List event sources
  list-types  List event source types
  ping        Manage ping sources

Plugins:
  kamelet      ~/.config/kn/plugins/kn-source-kamelet
----

Use `"kn <command> --help` for more information about a given command.
Use `kn options` for a list of global command-line options (applies to all commands).
You should see a new plugins section with the Kamelet source plugin listed. This means that you are now ready to use the plugin commands directly with the kn CLI.

To verify your installation, please run the following command:

[.console-input]
[#list-kn-plugins]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
kn plugin list
----

You should see an output similar to:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
- kn-source-kamelet : /Users/rsoares/.config/kn/plugins/kn-source-kamelet
----

By default, the `kn` CLI tool has a set of different event sources and its respective commands to manage those sources.
You can list all the available Kamelets with the following command:

[.console-input]
[#list-kamelets]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
kn source kamelet list -n knativetutorial
----

[#logging-ce-messages]
== View CloudEvents Messages

In order for you to view the events drained from the Kamelet `timed-greeter`, you need to deploy a utility service called `event-display`. Run the following command to deploy the service:

[.console-input]
[#deploy-ce-event-display]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
-----
cat <<EOF | kubectl create -n {tutorial-namespace} -f -
---
apiVersion: serving.knative.dev/v1

  template:
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: gcr.io/knative-releases/knative.dev/eventing-contrib/cmd/event_display
EOF
-----

A successful event display should show the following pod in the `{tutorial-namespace}`:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
watch kubectl get -n {tutorial-namespace} pods
----

List the Knative Service `event-display`:

[[camel-k-es-sink]]
== Custom Kamelet as source for a Knative Eventing Sink

Knative Eventing semantics allows you to link the Event Source to Event Sink using the **sink** block of the Knative Eventing source specification.

As part of this exercise we will deploy the same `timed-greeter` integration that you deployed <<deploy-camel-k-integration,earlier>> but now as a Kamelet. 

The following listing provides the details of Kamelet configuration:

.timed-greeter Kamelet
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1 #<1>
kind: Kamelet
metadata:
  name: timed-greeter
spec:
  definition:
    title: Timed Greeter Source
    description: Produces periodic events with a custom payload.
    required:
      - message
    type: object
    properties:
      period:
        title: Period
        description: The interval between two events in milliseconds
        type: integer
        default: 1000
      message:
        title: Message
        description: The message to generate
        type: string
        example: hello world
      contentType:
        title: Content Type
        description: The content type of the message being generated
        type: string
        default: text/plain
  dependencies:
    - "camel:core"#<2>
    - "camel:timer"
    - "camel:kamelet"
  template:
    from: #<3>
      uri: timer:tick
      parameters:
        period: 10000
      steps:
        - set-body:
            constant: "{{message}}"
        - set-header:
            name: "Content-Type"
            constant: "{{contentType}}"
        - transform:
            simple: "${body.toUpperCase()}"
        - to: "kamelet:sink"#<4>
----
<1> The Kamelet is provided by the API `sources.knative.dev`.
<2> The Kamelet spec has three main sections: `definition`, `dependencies` and `template`. 
The `dependencies` block is used to configure the Camel K integration specific properties such as dependencies, traits, etc. 
In this example we add the required dependencies such as `camel:core`, it is the dependency that you earlier passed via `kamel` CLI.
<3> The `from` attribute allows you define the Camel route.
<4> The event sink for messages from the Camel event source. A Source Kamelet sends data to a `kamelet:sink`, that will be replaced at runtime by a different target.

To deploy the Kamelet run the following command:

[.console-input]
[#deploy-greeter-camelsource]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
kubectl apply -n {tutorial-namespace} -f get-started/timed-greeter-kamelet.yaml
----

A successful deployment will show the Kamelet `timed-greeter` in ready state along with its pods in the {tutorial-namespace} namespace. 

[.console-input]
[#camel-k-watch-camelsources]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
kubectl get kamelet timed-greeter -n {tutorial-namespace}
----

When the Kamelet is successfully running you will see it in "READY" state `True`:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
NAME            READY
timed-greeter   True 
----

The event source is configured to drain the events to `kamelet:sink`.
Now we just need to bind the Kamelet to the service `event-display` and we can do that by using a `KameletBinding`.

Use Kamelets when you want to connect two or more components (external applications or services). Each Kamelet is basically a route template with configuration properties. You need to know which component you want to get data from (a source) and which component you want to send data to (a sink). You connect the source and sink components by adding Kamelets in a Kamelet Binding as illustrated in Figure below:

.Kamelet Binding source to sink
image::kamelet-binding-simple.png[]

The `KamelBinding` resource definition used to connect the `timed-greeter` source wuth the `event-display` service looks like:

.timed-greeter KameletBinding
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
kind: KameletBinding
metadata:
  name: timed-greeter-binding
spec:
  source:
    ref: #<1>
      kind: Kamelet
      apiVersion: camel.apache.org/v1alpha1
      name: timed-greeter
    properties:
      period: 5000
      message: Welcome to Apache Camel K
  sink:
    uri: <INPUT_YOUR_EVENT_DISPLAY_URL>#<2>
----
<1> Kubernetes reference to the previously created Kamelet.
<2> Sink the input to the URI of `event-display`.

To find out the URI of `event-display` please run the following command:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
kn service describe event-display -o url -n {tutorial-namespace}
----

Copy the url that the previous command returned and run the following command.  It will open an editor in which you can change the definition of the KameletBinding. *Replace the sink uri with the value you just copied and save the file*.  Once you do that, Kubernetes will create an object based on the saved definition.

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
kubectl create -f get-started/timed-greeter-binding.yaml --edit -o yaml -n {tutorial-namespace}
----

You can validate the state of your KameletBinding using:

[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
kn source kamelet binding list  -n {tutorial-namespace}
----

You should see an output stating it reached `Ready` state:

[.console-output]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
NAME                          PHASE   AGE    CONDITIONS   READY   REASON
timed-greeter-binding         Ready   45m    1 OK / 1     True
----

Once the `timed-greeter` and  `timed-greeter-binding` are ready, you will notice Knative sink `event-display` scale up to receive the events from `timed-greeter`.

.CamelSource `timed-greeter` pod and event-display pod

Open a new terminal and run the following command to start watching the events that are being drained into the sink `event-display` Knative service using the command:

[#camel-k-kn-eventing-logs]
[.console-input]
[source,bash,subs="+quotes,+attributes,+macros"]
----
stern -n {tutorial-namespace} event-display -c user-container
----

The `stern` command above should show the following output:

----

After few seconds you will see the `event-display` Knative Service scaling down to zero since it no longer receives events via the event source.
